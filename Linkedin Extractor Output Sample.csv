The telecom industry is changing as RAN moves from closed to open standards-based design. RAN solutions were restricted and proprietary, hindering interoperability and innovation. However, Open RAN has made the RAN ecosystem more flexible, modular, and vendor-neutral.
Open standards bring benefits. It enables operators chose best-of-breed components from several suppliers, boosting competition and innovation. It also promotes vendor-neutral interoperability amongst RAN components. This adaptability and interoperability increase RAN deployment efficiency, cost, and speed of uptake of new technologies and services.

Cross-functional team and partner organization collaboration and communication are crucial. To accomplish project milestones and deliverables, you will build relationships, align goals, and coordinate. You'll help VMware's platform integrate partner RAN software, improving RAN capabilities, network performance, and customer happiness.
The Work: What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?

The azure administrator skills you need to have been below.
A clear understanding of core Cloud Computing services is highly crucial for an Azure platform-specific job role. You need to understand the basic functioning of Networking, Databases, Software, and Servers in the Cloud.Basic Microsoft knowledge is mandatory for professionals looking for a career in Azure System Administration. You need to have experience in using products such as PowerShell and Office 365.As a result, you can understand the ways in which these services Integrate with Azure.Another important aspect to focus on is programming knowledge. Azure administrators need to have expertise in any one of the programming languages. Basic knowledge in open-source frameworks such as ASP.NET and programming languages such as JavaScript, SQL Server, and HTML5is preferable.
Day to Day Task of Azure Administrator in Azure infrastructure
Ability Restart/bounce the Azure components/clusters/VMs.Create and manage swap space on deployed cloud system per customer policies In support of the deployed cloud systems and environments.create custom scripts to automate support processes where applicable Ability to Power off/ Down the un-used VMs Ability to identify issues at Azure level and resolve.Manage Azure subscriptions and profiles.
Role Specific Skills:
Configure Networks
The complexity of TCP/IP inter-networking makes it a difficult topic for many IT experts to grasp. Due to the fact that you will never see the hardware supporting the Azure Networking Stack, this complexity increases in Azure.
To be a successful Azure Administrator, you must be familiar with necessary networking activities like:
establishing and setting up virtual networks.Routing Path orchestration, particularly in a hybrid cloud.choosing other Azure resources and managing public and private IP addresses for your virtual machines.
Read this blog to learn about some of the most crucial Microsoft Azure terms, including Azure Availability Zones, Azure Region, Availability Set, Fault Domain, and Update Domain, as well as how they relate to virtual machines.
Microsoft Azures most important concepts like AzureAvailability Zones, Region, Availability Set, Fault Domain, and Update Domain, and how it plays a key role in Virtual Machines.
 Monitor Resources and Log Analytics
You should learn how to use Log Analytics in the Azure portal to write Azure Monitor log queries. Also, one needs to have a basic understanding of how to perform the below tasks:
Use Log Analytics to write a simple queryUnderstand the schema of your dataFilter, sort, and group resultsApply a time rangeCreate chartsSave and load queriesExport and share queries Compute
The Azure Administrator is most often identified with infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which normally boils down to running Virtual Machines (VMs) in the cloud. To that point, to be a successful Azure Administrator, you should have familiarity with either or both of the Hypervisor platforms:
Microsoft Hyper-VVMware vSphere
Some VM-related Administrative Tasks Include:
Deploying VMs into Virtual Networks.Configuring VM for Optimum Cost, Performance, and Security.Backing up VMs and potentially providing Fail-over Recovery.
Containers represent a newer way to virtualize services, and Docker is extremely well-represented in Azure. Therefore, one should understand how to deploy, manage, and monitor containers.
 Implement and Manage Storage
Azure provides Administrators with essentially limitless storage. You need space to store VM virtual hard disks, Database Files, Application Data, and potentially useful data. Furthermore, you should also study PowerShell/CLI commands, which would help you to create/remove storage.
Also, it is your responsibility to make use of Microsoft tools for Cloud Computing's shared responsibility Model. Core tasks include:
Securing Data against unauthorized accessBacking Up Data and making it efficient to restore when needed.Configuring long-term archival storage to maintain corporate compliance. Implement Security and Protecting Identities
The security stakes are high in the Azure public cloud because your business stores its proprietary data on someone Elses infrastructure. The shared responsibility model in cloud computing means the responsibility is on you as an Azure Administrator to make use of Microsoft's manifold security controls. Also, you'll need some representative skills which include:
Encrypting data in transit, at rest, and in use.Protecting Azure Active Directory accounts against compromise.Reducing the attack surface of all your Azure resources.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco
# WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",jobs.cisco.com,"['Computer Hardware', 'Computer Software', 'Computer Networking']",,"[[4, 14], [36]]"

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A block-chain company. An AI/Machine Learning
company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colourful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing. Be you, with us!
